# Experiment-13
## Program 1
## Aim
To implement Function Overloading.

## Software used
Visual Studio Code

## Theory
Function overloading in C++ lets you have multiple functions with the same name in the same scope, as long as their parameter lists differ in number, type, or both. The compiler distinguishes between these functions based on the types or number of arguments used in the call. This improves readability and usability by allowing one function name to handle similar tasks with different input types.

To overload functions, they must differ in parameter types, the number of parameters, or both; the return type alone cannot differentiate them.

## Conclusion
We learned how to implement function overloading in C++.

## Program 2
## Aim
To implement Operator overloading.

## Software used
Visual Studio Code

## Theory
Operator overloading in C++ lets programmers redefine the behavior of standard operators (like +, -, *, ==) for user-defined types (classes or structs). This allows class objects to use these operators meaningfully, such as defining how the + operator works for a custom Complex number class.

However, not all operators can be overloaded (e.g., ::, sizeof, ?:). The overloaded operator acts like a function and can have different implementations based on the class, but it does not change the operator's precedence or associativity.
